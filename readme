 # 30-Day JavaScript Challenge
Completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge.

## Day 01: Variable and Data Type
- Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

## Day 02: Operators
- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variables.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

## Day 03: Control Structures
- Implement and understand basic `if-else` control flow.
- Use nested `if-else` statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize `switch` cases for control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.

## Day 04: Loops
- Understand and use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize `while` loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply `do...while` loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) to control the flow of loops.

## Day 05: Functions
- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize higher-order functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
- Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.

## Day 06: Arrays
- Create and manipulate arrays using various methods.
- Transform and aggregate array data using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
- Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods.
- Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Day 07: Objects
- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Understand and use the `this` keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
